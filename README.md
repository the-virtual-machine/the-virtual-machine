## About My Live Coding

I use Sonic Pi to create live-coded music performances. Sonic Pi is a powerful and easy-to-use live coding environment for creating music. My goal is to inspire others to explore coding through music and to show the creative potential of this amazing tool.

### What You Can Expect

Stay tuned for updates, new videos, and live streams!

Happy coding and music-making!
